## üîß Configuration

### API Key Setup

The app uses NewsAPI for fetching news. You have two options:

**Option 1: Use included demo key (default)**
- Works out of the box with limited requests
- Fallback to mock data if quota exceeded

**Option 2: Use your own API key**
1. Get free API key from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/)
2. Add to `.env` file:
```env
REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Customization

**Change theme colors:**
Edit the `theme` object in `App.tsx`:
```typescript
const theme = {
  dark: {
    accent: '#8b5cf6',  // Change primary color
    // ... other colors
  }
}
```

**Modify news categories:**
```typescript
const categories = ['All', 'Stocks', 'Crypto', 'Tech', 'Business', 'Markets'];
```

**Adjust refresh interval for market data:**
```typescript
const marketInterval = setInterval(updateMarketData, 30000); // 30 seconds
```

## üì± Build for Production

### Android APK
```bash
npx expo build:android
```

### iOS IPA
```bash
npx expo build:ios
```

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

eas build --platform android

# Build for iOS

```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Issue: API rate limit exceeded**
- Solution: The app automatically falls back to mock data

**Issue: Images not loading**
- Solution: Check internet connection; mock data has fallback images

**Issue: Expo Go won't connect**
- Solution: Ensure phone and computer are on same WiFi network

**Issue: Keyboard covers input**
- Solution: App uses KeyboardAvoidingView, but you may need to adjust behavior prop for your device
